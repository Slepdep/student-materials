# Title

## Executive Summary

Exeter wants software that will connect students to each other for projects. This program will be able to connect students based on their attributes and skills to give students the tools to create a well rounded team with synergy. It will be a social network designed to help students achieve this by giving them space to both express their qualities, goals, and professional personalities and to communicate with others to find like minded students for projects. It will allow for a list of interests and goals set by each individual along with set tags that they can tag themselves with to find people with similar tags.

## Business Objectives

This program aims to be a meeting place for students to interact with others with similar interests in the process of finding and creating project teams. It will be a chatroom with some social media features, including a very small profile space and special chatrooms/servers that students can make after they've established their group.

## Background

This project is being initiated because of a need of a group oriented chat system designed to help students and individuals alike to find a group for projects. 

## Scope

-Main Chatroom for a school or course
-Small profile that lists a name, icon, "tags" of what their interests and qualities are, and additionally tags that are for any groups they join.
-Offshoot chatroom for each established group, granted access by an admin to create it.
-ability to view other users' tags
-group chatrooms are invisible to those that do not have the tag.


## Functional requirements

Users will be able to create an account and choose from tags specified by the school's chat that they're joining for students, as well as letting students pick qualities and interest tags for themselves.
The chatrooms will be a place where users can post and read text and images and limited code, with a school's main page being the main place to chat with chats available specially for the tags chosen by the students.
Students will be able to make their own related but invisible (unless the tag is given) chat for their group. 
Students in groups will be allowed to hand out the tag for said group to people who do not have the tag.
Users will be able to view the tags of other users, but not the chats if they do not share a tag for a group or interest.



## Personnel requirements

This project will likely require:
A project manager
A medium-sized development team of coders
A bug tester
A systems admin
A moderator that moderates activity that could affect the functionality of the application and terms of service of the application itself (ie botnet or DDOS attempts)
Quality Assurance (Ideally with someone from Exeter to test the product's functionality)

All else (instructors, moderators for specific chats) should be up to the school using the program.

## Delivery schedule

Delivery Schedule should be around 1.5 years or 18 months.

First quarter of the year would be focused on getting the basic functions of posting and getting content onto the skeleton framework of the chatroom itself.

Second Quarter work on both profile and tag features.

Third Quarter work on auxillary servers and bug testing begins on the code.

Fourth quarter design and UI is finalized, bug testing continues.

Fifth Quarter is QA's time to be hands on and test the functionality of the app.

Sixth is the final bug check (to see if QA unearthed anything themselves) and then launch.

## Other requirements

The app will be native to most all Operating Systems for the app itself, and a in browser version will be available to users as well, which will work with many of the major browsers.

## Assumptions

Expectation is Javascript and C++; Express in particular. 

## Limitations

Screen sharing and one on one friend chatting is not an immediate concern for this timeframe, but could be added in the future if the app is moderately successful or the impetus from users exists to add it and is hard to ignore.

## Risks

A risk of this project could be that the system isn't used; sometimes even when good options are available for such chats they're just not used and that's a definite consideration of this. This risk could be mitigated by forcing exeter schools to use this but it's not a guarantee.
